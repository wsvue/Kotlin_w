Program Elements

When learning a new language, a proper language, like French, Spanish, etc., you'll probably start with parts of speech
and the rules that govern them. It'd be easier to approach a language if we had some basic understanding of how its parts come
together. A Kotlin program contains literals, variables, expression, keywords, and a whole lot of other things.

Literals
Kotlin provides literals for the basic types(numbers, character, Boolean, String).
- int
- double
- string
- char
- bool (boolean)
